                <h1><b><u>The Guernica</u></b></h1>
                <h3>The Guernica is an incredible painting by Pablo Piscaso. I love this painting because it is very absract and unique. When you look at a painting like the Mona Lisa it is very plain, but the Guernica is very different than the others.</h3>

                <h1><b><u>The Starry Night</u></b></h1>
                <h3>The Starry Night is a beautiful painting by  Vincent van Gogh. I love this painting because it shows the beauty in the night sky. It shows the bright stars, galaxies, the moon, and the beautiful city that can admire the night sky.</h3>

                <h1><b><u>The Scream</u></b></h1>
                <h3>The Scream is a amazing painting by Edvard Munch. I love the Scream because of the wide variety of colors in the background. I also enjoy the man in the front screaming, I think that it shows a lot about society because most people are afraid of the unknown.</h3>
