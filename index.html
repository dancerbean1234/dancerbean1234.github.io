<h3>Every successful dictator should possess qualities of power, military experience, and logic. A good dictator should rise and maintain the power over their citizens. Adolf Hitler gained and obtained power over the Germans by rising up through the ranks via the Nazi party. Successful dictators should also have a high experience in the military. Hitler had a lot of military experience from his service in the German Army in WWI. Dictators that are successful should be very logical. Hitler was very logical and strategic when turning German people against the Jews.  Adolf Hitler was a successful dictator because he had the qualities of domination, experiences in war, and strategy.</h3>

        <h1><center>Introduction</center></h1>
        <br>
        <h4>“Throughout history, these tyrants [dictators] have ruled with an iron fist, attempting to annihilate their enemies and oppress their people in a grab for absolute power” (BIO., 2016). To obtain this power over citizens, a dictator should be surrounded by the right environment.  For example, citizens who are fearful for their lives and future for the country create a perfect situation for a dictator.  With this fear, the dictator can use tools like propaganda to make the people feel as though with he/she in rule, the country will succeed and they will be safe. Hitler was a powerful dictator and was more successful because of environment.  Poor economy, unemployment, and resentment by the people worked in Hitler's favor, creating the conditions ideal for him to rise to power as dictator in Germany.

        <h1><center>Poor Economy</center></h1>
        <br>
        <h4>First, the economy in German was underperforming, causing political instability and  Hitler to rise to power.  The economic chaos lead to the fall of the pre-existing government, the Weimar Republic.  Because the previous government collapsed, Hitler was able to assume the responsibility of the nation. Next, the Treaty of Versailles created an economic down fall after World War I. Germany was fined, “About 269bn gold marks, to be exact - the equivalent of around 100,000 tons of gold,” putting the nation further into debt (Lang, 2010).  Lastly, Germany spent 37,775,000,000 U.S. dollars on WWI.  This additional war debt added stress on an already fragile German economy.  To conclude, a destroyed economy created an ideal situation for Hitler to rise to power because he promised the citizens to fix it.

       <h1><center>High Unempolyment</center></h1>
        <br>
        <h4>Next, the unemployment among the German people further added uncertainty among the nation and Hitler to rise to power.  First, the amount of unemployed people in Germany increased to 8.4% of the population (Simkin, 2014).  Hitler used this in his favor because he used propaganda to explain how he was going create additional jobs. Next, after Hitler became dictator, many adults still did not have jobs to provide for their families. He created a program called the Voluntary Labor Services (VLS) to provide jobs for these adults. Finally, children in Germany did not have jobs to help their families financially. Hitler created another work program called the Voluntary Youth Services (VYS) to solve these problems. All in all, correcting unemployment challenges among the county created support for Hitler because he is able to fix these problems in office.

      <h1><center>Resentment</center></h1>
        <br>
        <h4>Finally, resentment among the citizens created a good environment for Hitler to rise to power. Citizens were angry about the Treaty of Versailles and wanted change. First, after WW1 the surrounding countries wanted to decrease this size in Germany’s army. The German people did not support this reparation and Hitler wanted to change the military status. Next, Germany wad charged 269bn Gold Marks after the first World War.  People were very furious about this reparation and did not want to lose money to the other countries. Lastly, after WW1 Germany’s land was reduced by a significant amount. Germany lost its territory to several of the allied countries making the Germans very angry. All in all, resentment among the citizens helpful to a dictator because they can make promises to change the problems.

       <h1><center>Conclusion</center></h1>
        <br>
        <h4>All in all, a dictator will be more successful in right environment to gain and hold power over the citizens. For example, a failing economy, unemployment among the people, and displeasure within the country can instill fear and frustration among the nation. With these difficulties the citizens will be support of a for a leader to take action and change the country in a different direction. When the citizens are fearful, the dictator can use propaganda to make it seem as though they will fix these problems among the country. Hitler had the right environment because the Germans were looking for a leader to change Germany in a positive way. To conclude, a dictator should rule with an iron fist and create change in their environment to be successful.
